What did you see on line 1?
This prints a random integer between 5 and 20 (both inclusive).

What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
The smallest number is 5, and the largest is 20.

What did you see on line 2?
This prints a random number from the range 3 to 9, stepping by 2. So, possible outputs could be 3, 5, 7, or 9.

What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
The smallest is 3, and the largest is 9.

Could line 2 have produced a 4?
No, because the step value is 2, so it can only produce odd numbers in this range.

What did you see on line 3?
This prints a random floating-point number between 2.5 and 5.5.

What was the smallest number you could have seen, what was the largest?
The smallest number is 2.5, and the largest is 5.5.
